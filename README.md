## Garmin Health Insights: A Data-Driven Exploration of Heart Rate and Activity Trends

Garmin Data Analysis Project: Exploring heart rate and activity trends using data collected from the GarminConnect API. Includes data cleaning, analysis, and reporting phases.

## Tools

- __Python__ üêç: Core language for data collection, cleaning, and analysis.
- __VS Code__ üíª: Code editor for development and debugging.
- __Jupyter Notebook__ üìí: Interactive environment for data exploration and visualization.
- __Git__ üå±: Version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.

### API Connection Test

The script ``test/api.py`` serves as a first step to ensure successful communication with the GarminConnect API. It verifies the following:

1. __Authentication__
2. __Basic API Call__: Fetches a sample activity
3. __Error Handling__: Detects and reports potential issues

### Initial Architecture of the Project

``data/``: This folder contains all project data. <br>
- ``data/raw``: Stores raw data collected directly from the API
- ``data/cleaned``: Stores processed and cleaned data ready for the analysis. <br>

``script.py``: This script handles the interaction with the GarminConnect API. It fetches raw data such as heart rate, steps, and sleep data for further processing. <br>
``main.ipynb``: A Jupyter Notebook for performing statistical analysis, visualizing trends, and generating insights using the cleaned data.<br>
``.env``: A file for securely storing sensitive information, such as API credentials (email and password). This file is excluded from version control for security purposes.

### Project Goals: Exploring Heart Rate Trends

This project focuses on analyzing heart rate data collected from Garmin devices to uncover meaningful insights about daily activity, sleep patterns, and physical performance. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to answer key questions related to heart rate behavior and its correlation with lifestyle factors.

#### Key Questions:
1. __What are the average, minimum, and maximum heart rate values on a daily basis?__  
    * Calculate the minimum, average, and maximum heart rate globally.
    * Visualize these values using appropriate charts.
    * Track the reference values for the most recent day available.

2. __How does heart rate differ during sleep compared to waking hours?__
    * Compare the average heart rate during sleep with the average heart rate between 12:00 PM and 10:00 PM.
    * Calculate the average heart rate for deep sleep, REM sleep, and light sleep.

3. __How does nighttime heart rate change on days with physical activity?__
    * Does the average nighttime heart rate increase or decrease on days with physical activity?

4. __Is there a correlation between the number of steps taken and the average heart rate?__
    * Are the number of steps and the average heart rate correlated?
    * Divide days into categories based on step count ranges and analyze how the average heart rate varies across these categories.
